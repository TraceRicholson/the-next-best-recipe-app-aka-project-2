# What exactly is this?
We're so glad you asked.  Robot Kitchen is a website containing a select, currated list of recipes for your tasting enjoyment.  It's a simple way to get the recipe you want without having to read 20 paragraphs about a person.  This really is the ultimate recipe website you've been searching for your whole life.

# How do I install this?
Easy!  See steps 1 - 53 below.

Kidding.

1: Fork and clone this to your desktop.<br/>
2: Open the project file, and cd into "backend" and run npm-instll from the command line.<br/>
3:  Repeat step 2, but run the command in "frontend" instead.<br/>
4:  (DATABASE FILE UPLOAD PENDING)

# How do I use this?
This part really is simple.  Upon arriving to the home page, click the recipes tab at the top.  This will bring you to a page containing all the recipes.  From here, you are able to browse our strictly currated selection to find a recipe you like.  Once you've settled on one, you can either click the picture to learn more, or add the recipe to your favorites.  To view your favorites, click on the favorites tab in the navigation bar.  That's it!
